                <p><i>
                    When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health.
                    I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking pop and beer
                    on a regular basis. I decided to do something about it.
                    I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I did, however, have multiple ups and downs.
                    It took me years to make a decision to thoroughly examine my workouts and make necessary changes.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I care deeply about my clients, and there’s nothing of more value to me
                    than helping somebody go through an experience that makes them happy, confident, and strong.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I realize how being overweight affects many aspects of your life,
                    and I want to be there for you and help you discover the benefits and
                    joys of training that helped me become the person I am today.
                    I’m here to be your personal guide on every step of the journey.</i>
